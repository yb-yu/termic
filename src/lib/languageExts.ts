// Which grammar a buffer gets, and how it is found. Imported ONLY by the
// lazily-loaded editor / diff panes: `@codemirror/language-data` has ~150
// grammars behind it and `lib/mainChunkGuard.test.ts` pins that none of them
// are reachable from app start. `lib/languages` is the module everything else
// touches.
//
// The set of languages is CodeMirror's published registry, so a `.zig` or a
// `.php` file lights up with no edit here. Three things are layered on top:
//
//   CUSTOM   grammars the registry cannot serve at all (see below)
//   OVERLAY  filename rules the registry lacks, reusing ITS loaders
//   registry everything else, as published
//
// First match wins, so CUSTOM and OVERLAY beat the registry on a tie.

 *  - Makefile — nothing upstream has a Makefile grammar at all.
 *  - ProtoBuf — the registry ships a mode that predates proto3. Same NAME as
 *    the registry entry on purpose: being first, it replaces it rather than
 *    sitting next to it in the picker.
 *  - Elixir  — simply absent from the registry.
 *  - Svelte  — absent, and the HTML fallback it used to get missed `{#if}`
 *    blocks and every `<script>` in the file.
 *  - Astro   — no CodeMirror grammar exists anywhere. `lib/astroMode` builds
 *    one out of the two parsers the file is actually made of.
 *  - Terraform / HCL — absent. Separate names let .tfvars use its own LSP
 *    language id without sending unrelated HCL files to terraform-ls.
 *
 *  React and Vue need nothing here: the registry's JSX / TSX and Vue entries
 *  are real grammars, and Vue's loads `@codemirror/lang-vue`.
 *
 *  Every loader is a dynamic import, so a grammar costs nothing until a file
 *  that needs it is opened. */
