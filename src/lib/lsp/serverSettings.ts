// Configuring a language server, without termic inventing a dialect (GH #174).
//
// The tempting design is a settings screen of friendly toggles that termic
// translates into whatever each server understands. It was built and thrown
// away, for the reason that kills every mapping layer: zuban takes
// `typeCheckingMode` in `initializationOptions`, ty takes `ty.diagnosticMode`
// as a pulled setting, basedpyright takes `python.analysis.diagnosticMode`,
// and they do not even agree on how to spell the same VALUE
// (`open-files-only` against `openFilesOnly`). Three servers, one language,
// three dialects, all of them moving. A mapping table is a second, staler copy
// of five projects' documentation, and the day it drifts the app silently
// sends a key nobody reads.
//
// What a person actually needs is the truth, stated once, in their project's
// terms: **this is the server that runs, this is the file it reads, here are
// its docs.** Almost every server takes its real configuration from a file in
// the repo (`pyproject.toml`, `pyrightconfig.json`, `tsconfig.json`,
// `rust-analyzer.toml`), which is committed, team-shared, and works in every
// other editor those people use. Pointing at that file beats owning a copy of
// its schema, and it is the answer that stays true.
//
// The Advanced box is the exception, not the interface: some settings exist
// ONLY over LSP (gopls has no config file at all), so termic forwards a raw
// block verbatim into whichever channel that server reads. It is not
// validated, because the server is the authority on its own keys.
