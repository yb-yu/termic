// The bug this exists for could not have been written from imagination: asking
// zuban for `Store` in a Django project returns 95 symbols, 64 of which are
// the `from stores.models import Store` line in some other module, and nothing
// in the protocol says so. They are simply the binding an import creates, and
// a binding is a variable. Ranked by name alone they tied with the class and
// beat it on the tiebreak, so the definition fell off the end of a 25-row list
// and the search looked unable to find a class sitting in the same repo.
//
// Each fixture is one query against one server, captured with
// scratchpad/lsp-probe.mjs:
//
//   zuban          "Store"      a real Django project     95 symbols
//   tsgo           "EditorPane" this repo                  2 symbols
//   rust-analyzer  "LspServer"  this repo's src-tauri      2 symbols
//   gopls          "Store"      a two-package Go module    6 symbols
//
// Re-record with:
//   SYMBOL_QUERY=Store SYMBOL_OUT=<file> node scratchpad/lsp-probe.mjs <lang> <root> <file>
