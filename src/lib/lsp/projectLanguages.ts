// What is this project written in, when no file is open to ask (GH #174).
//
// Double-shift with nothing in the editor is exactly when someone wants to
// find a symbol, and exactly when the app has no buffer to take a language
// from. The dialog used to shrug: "Search files", no symbols, and no way to
// discover that symbol search exists at all.
//
// The answer is already in the file list the dialog fetched, so this costs no
// IPC and no directory walk. Two signals, because either alone is wrong:
//
//   - **Manifests.** `pyproject.toml` says Python about a repo whose Python is
//     one script, and that is the right answer: somebody set it up as a Python
//     project.
//   - **Extension counts.** A repo with 300 `.py` files and no manifest is a
//     Python project whatever its root looks like, and plenty of real trees
//     (scripts, monorepo subtrees, anything vendored) have no manifest on top.
//
// Ordered by strength, so the dialog leads with what the project is most
// obviously about.
